# 3d-model
Engine for randomly generating 3D building models in CityGML format. Forms an optimal a basis for 3D cadastre.

#Note
This tool does not, in any way, try to outshine ESRI's cityGML. Rather it provides a different approach towards creating 3D models of buildings, streets and vegetation in a 
more developer friendly format.

#TODOs
1. Create a .gml parser in javascript.
2. Visualize parsed .gml models in leaflet/cesium maps
